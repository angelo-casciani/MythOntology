# MythOntology
MythOntology is an OWL ontology which aims to formalize the domain of Greek mythology.
This ontology represents the knowledge about Greek myths, focusing on figures (gods, creatures and mortals), places, objects and principles contained in them, and detailing their relationships through appropriate object and data properties.
It can be used in a variety of applications, such as in education or cultural heritage, to represent the domain knowledge and make it accessible to a wide audience.

## Tool
- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) (>= v.5.5.0)

I choose Protégé as ontology editor, a powerful tool for creating and managing ontologies. Protege provides a user-friendly interface for creating classes, individuals, and properties, as well as for making inferences and answering queries.

It also has built-in reasoning capabilities, which allow us to check the consistency of the ontology and make inferences about the individuals and their properties.

Protégé can use the ontology to answer queries using SPARQL and DL languages (reported in [Queries](https://github.com/AngeloC99/MythOntology/Queries)), to easily find the needed information and make predictions based on the relationships between the individuals.
